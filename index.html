        <h4>About me</h4>
        <p id="about">I am an enthusiastic and hard-working individual. I have enjoyed a career as a self-employed Life Insurance Agent as well as a Captain in the Army as 
            a Military Intelligence Officer. I approach any problem with a systematic thought process. I am very organized and able to break a large problem 
            down into the small tasks essential to create the solution. I am very proficient at using online technology and will use my analytical mind and leadership potential to
            excel as a Software Developer </p>
